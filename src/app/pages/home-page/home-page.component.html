            <h5 class="card-title">Why Buy Vehicle Insurance?</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Vehicle insurance is not just a legal mandate in India under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, but a vital financial safeguard. 
                With over 4.5 lakh road accidents and 2 lakh vehicle thefts annually, having insurance protects you from significant financial liabilities.
                 Comprehensive policies cover damages caused by natural disasters like floods and earthquakes, which are increasingly common.
                  Repair costs for vehicles can be steep, ranging from ₹5,000 to over ₹1,00,000, making insurance a cost-effective solution. 
                  Third-party insurance, which accounts for 70% of motor claims in India, shields you from liabilities involving others. 
                  Affordable premiums, starting at just ₹500 for two-wheelers, and customizable add-ons ensure peace of mind while driving. 
                  Moreover, tax benefits for self-employed individuals make it an even smarter investment.
